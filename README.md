# Moving Away from GitHub

I’m moving my projects from GitHub to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/adivius).

## Why?

GitHub is not a good home for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
Here are some of the reasons why:

- **Owned by Microsoft** – a company with a long history of exploiting, undermining, and monetizing open source communities.
- **Proprietary and Closed Source** – GitHub itself is not FOSS. Hosting FOSS on a closed, centralized, and opaque platform contradicts the very values of software freedom.
- **AI that exploits code** – GitHub Copilot and other Microsoft AI tools are trained on publicly available repositories without consent. This essentially turns community contributions into raw material for commercial products.
- **Unclear user rights** – Contributors have little to no control over how their code is used once uploaded. User data and code can be exploited in ways you never agreed to.
- **Centralization risks** – Concentrating so much of the world’s open source projects in one corporate-controlled place is dangerous for the resilience of the ecosystem.

## Alternatives

I’ve chosen to move my code to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org), a community-driven, non-profit platform based on [Gitea](https://gitea.io), which is itself FOSS.
Codeberg aligns better with the principles of openness, transparency, and user freedom.
